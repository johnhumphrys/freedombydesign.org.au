<h3>A quick update,</h3>

<p>
  Hello,
</p>
<p>
  This was a very difficult decision for us to make. Many Healesville community
  members and businesses rely on Beth in their daily life.
</p>
<p>
  We really appreciate everyone's support in helping us build our Social
  Enterprise and will continue to work hard to figure out how to safely provide
  this essential local taxi service.
</p>
<p>
  Beth the Social Enterprise is off the road~!!!
</p>
<p>
  Everyone who loves Beth knows that our main aim is to help keep people safe.
  Beth is known for her use of eucalyptus spray... it smells great; but more
  importantly, it helps keep people safe from airborne viruses.
</p>
<p>
  We have done our research and can't guarantee that our eucalyptus spray or any
  other available products will protect people from being exposed to Corona
  Virus while they travel in Beth.
</p>
<p>
  We think it is safer for our drivers, passengers and the broader community if
  we park Beth. The status of the COVID-19 situation will be closely monitored
  we will review our decision on a weekly basis.
</p>
<p>
  Stay safe and travel well.
</p>
