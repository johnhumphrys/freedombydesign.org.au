<h3>Bookings</h3>

<p>
  We encourage booking trips in advance so we can help people to arrive at their
  appointments and destinations on time.
</p>

<p>
  Beth stays local to Healesville on weekend nights. We have a number of options
  to help people who need to travel further. During the week, Beth does longer
  trips to help community members get to important medical appointments.
</p>

<p>
  To advance book Beth, please phone and speak with her driver on
  <b>0499 773 393</b>. Beth is currently working limited hours, so leave a
  message if the phone is unattended.
</p>
<p>
  We also take bookings in advance by email
