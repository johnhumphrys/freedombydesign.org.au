  It has been yet another huge weekend for our very special taxi… Beth the
  Social Enterprise Taxi. We always meet great people who visit the beautiful
  Yarra Valley. It is lovely to share in their weekend away and help them relax
  into the Valley’s plentiful places for indulgent venues because they know we
  will get them home! In many ways, Beth has become a part of the array of
  attractions in the Yarra Valley. It warms our hearts when tourists get in Beth
  and talk about how many businesses and people highly recommend us.
</p>
<p>
  The spirit of Beth is the center from which we provide a taxi service. We
  often explain to people that we are not taxi drivers, but we drive a taxi. We
  are not degrading other people who drive taxis; far from it. We have a huge
  appreciation of them and the work they do. Having said that, the taxi industry
  doesn’t have a great reputation overall.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, we are part of the community. We love catching up with our locals
  who are just not passengers but our supporters and friends. It feels amazing
  when we get a phone call from someone telling us we have a taillight out, have
  offers of support and encouragement.
</p>
<p>
  Building the Social Enterprise has become a labour of love and has always
  thrown challenges and cur balls in both business and personal sense. But it’s
  so easy to fall in love with the spirit of Beth and share that spirit with
  every person we meet along the way.

  I write this from a deeply personal place; something I struggle sharing with
  others.
</p>
<p>
  I grew up in a small country town called Merrigum. Reflecting back, I’m
  grateful for the safeness and innocents I grew up with. In a sense, I am still
  naïve and struggle to make sense of many things. I was painfully shy kid who
  isn’t great socially… I still am in my 50s!
</p>
<p>
  I went to university when I was 35. I had never really completed anything
  during my life and decided that it would be really cool to have a degree. I
  took off when I was 15 to work on a horse stud (my life dream). I dropped out
  of school right before the year 10 exams. I knew then, and I know now that I’m
  not great at applying myself; I have the ability but don’t put in the effort.
  To me, my time was not ill spent. I’d daydream of my perfect life… spent a lot
  of time trying to figure out how people ticked… watched what was going on
  around me… and trying really hard to do right by people.
</p>
<p>
  I never had the strength to stand up for myself properly. I guess most of us
  would identify with… how do I stand up for myself and my beliefs without
  offending or hurting someone. A lot of us would also identify with
  internalising the hurt or injustice… and then trying to deal with it. For me
  it has always been abusing food, lack of self-care and avoidance. This
  combined with shyness.. crikies!!!
</p>
<p>
  I remember when I was a kid. The doctor said can you take tablets, or do you
  need medicine? Not wanting to question authority, I said, yep I can take
  tablets. I was wrong. A strange reflection perhaps. But really, it’s just an
  example of a lifelong ability to bite off more than I could chew!
</p>
<p>
  Predictable enough, my 15 year old horse stud experience didn’t go so well.
  The picture in my mind of Mum coming and ‘rescuing’ me after a year is forever
  close to my heart. I didn’t realise at the time because I was so starstruck at
  my animal career that I wasn’t treated very well. I’m glad Mum did. I was a
  bit broken.
</p>
<p>
  Over the next few years I loved my time in the dairy industry… but that’s a
  whole other story. I decided to go to night school and do Year 12. I loved it
  and got great grades. I had the study bug!
</p>
<p>
  My hubby at the time wasn’t interested in farming. I ended up living in the
  Melbourne suburb, Bayswater! I rehomed my horses and cows. I wasn’t unhappy
  with the idea and have no regrets about moving to Melbourne.
</p>
<p>
  When we moved to Melbourne, I went to TAFE and studied to become a youth
  worker… that’s another story. I worked as an integration aide with a young man
  who struggled socially at primary school. We became foster parents and various
  kids come and go. I worked as a notetaker at TAFE and started doing my degree
  in Applied Science (disability studies) part time.
</p>
<p>
  One of the people I took notes for at TAFE lived in a group home. I just
  couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Happily living in my daydream bubble, I
  had no idea that such places existed; it sounded awful.
</p>
<p>
  I figured that to be able to understand what group homes are and how they
  work, I should experience it. I took a group home team leader role with a
  large Melbourne organisation.
</p>
<p>
  It was an interesting time. The shift from institutionalisation to
  Normalisation thinking began. Individualisation and the social model of
  support had begun. Institutions/Group homes had a name change. They become
  Community Residential Units… then Supported Living Houses… then they went back
  to being called Group Homes. Individual Person Plans became known as Person
  Centered Plans… and on it goes…
</p>
<p>
  It was interesting to be at uni and learn the theory behind what goes on
  within the ‘disability sector’. But really… nothing made sense to me. People
  are people. Why do well-meaning people further disable other people? What
  makes a person think that they know what is right for another person? Why do
  people hide behind legislation in an attempt to justify their actions towards
  vulnerable people?
</p>
<p>
  On a personal level, this was a really challenging time. I went on a personal
  quest with a psychologist to figure out who am I… and why am I the way I am? I
  never really figured it out. When questioning what I saw and what I was
  expected to do within Group Home and foster care settings, it never ended
  well. It became clear to me that initialisation is a mindset; a force to be
  reckoned with. It breaks people!
</p>
<p>
  I went in search of a solution and ended up in America on a study tour for my
  uni placement. Me in Los Angeles.. good heavens. It all become clear!
</p>
<p>
  I spent the next few years trying to get Freedom by Design Inc. off the ground
  to provide an alternative for people who are unhappy living in an
  institutionalised setting.
</p>
<p>
  I’ve always been quite open that I feel my biggest challenge is getting out of
  my own way. That might sound weird… but that shy, socially challenged,
  internalising kid is still very much present.
</p>
<p>
  Again, I looked for answers. I couldn’t believe it when I gained a scholarship
  to The School for Social Entrepreneurs; an amazing school for community
  members who want to help make change happen. Part of this was to develop
  learning goals… <b>‘I’m shy, I’m broke… I’ll drive a taxi’</b>
</p>
<p>
  If you’ve read this far… thank you!
</p>
<p>
  I plan to share my story a bit… the good, the bad and the ugly. I’m hoping it
  will help make a bit more of a change in regard to how people are treated. I
  also hope that it will help me gather the strength and support to finish what
  I started in founding Freedom by Design Inc. (FBD).
</p>
<p>Ohh… if you’re wondering about the earlier picture of my tattoo…</p>
<p>
  I promised myself that I would give up if FBD wasn’t funded by the time I
  turned 50. My 3 gorgeous sisters shouted me a birthday tattoo instead!!!
