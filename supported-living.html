<h3>What is Supported Living?</h3>
<p>
  Supported Living is a different way of thinking in terms of support provision.
</p>
<p>
  Supported Living is not a program or a model; it is a way of supporting people
  with developmental disabilities as they live their life and maximize the use
  of their supports.
</p>
<p>
  This method of supporting people with complex needs is not a new concept. It
  has changed lives of individuals, families, support people and communities
  worldwide.
</p>
<p>
  Supported Living is NOT about checklists and meeting criteria; it is about
  real life. We change the way we do things in response to each person’s needs
  to enable them to live their own life.
</p>
<p>
  When we use the terms ‘Individualized’ or ‘Circles of Support’ or ‘Person
  Centered’, we mean it in the true sense of their design. We offer deep,
  honest, transparent support and understand that at times, we may get it wrong.
  We embrace this as a learning opportunity to reflect, learn and move forward.
  After all, if we are to be serious and provide person centered support, we
  walk the journey of life with those we serve and grow and learn with them.
